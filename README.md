# Gasilec (Firefighter)
**Gasilec** is a Python-based game where you play as a firefighter aiming to protect trees from spreading fires in a randomly generated forest. The game is inspired by Hartnell's pursuit-evasion game on graphs, with unique challenges where each decision could save or doom part of the forest!

## Game Overview
In **Gasilec**, a fire breaks out in a random forest graph, with nodes representing trees and edges representing paths through which the fire can spread. Each turn, you (the firefighter) can protect one tree to prevent the fire from spreading to it. However, the fire will continue to spread through unprotected paths.

### Objectives
- Strategically protect trees to contain the fire.
- Prevent the fire from spreading to as many trees as possible.
